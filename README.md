Finance-PaycheckRecords-Fetcher
===============================

Finance-PaycheckRecords-Fetcher is a Perl module that can download paystubs from [PaycheckRecords.com](http://paycheckrecords.com), so you can save them for your records.  You can use [Finance::PaycheckRecords](https://metacpan.org/pod/Finance%3A%3APaycheckRecords) (available separately) to extract information from the stored paystubs.

This is a Git repository where development of Finance-PaycheckRecords-Fetcher takes place.  For more information, visit [Finance-PaycheckRecords-Fetcher on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/Finance-PaycheckRecords-Fetcher).
